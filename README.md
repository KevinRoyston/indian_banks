I used GraphQL method in step1 i used Flask and Ariadne to construct web server and GraphQL API.The bank and branch data was first loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.For quarying dataframes were transfered into a dictionary.Using Ariadne's gql function, the GraphQL schema was constructed, defining types such as Bank and Branch along with a Query type to get the list of branches. The GraphQL schema was defined using Ariadne's gql function specifying types like Bank and Branch as well as a Query type to retrieve the list of branches. A resolver function was created to handle the GraphQL queries and return the relevant data.We also implemented error handling to ensure that the API responds appropriately to unexpected inputs or missing data. Testing was done using Python's unittest framework to validate the functionality of the API endpoints.
